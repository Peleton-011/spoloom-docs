		<h2><strong>Technological Design and Considerations</strong></h2>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>
			For the main structure and the development process Shopify Hydrogen
			is the tech that will be used. The website requirements include
			interfacing with Shopify and a Shopify deployment, Hydrogen provides
			a much more flexible and adaptable framework than Liquid and the
			admin development page (the other Shopify alternatives).
		</p>
		<p>
			Shopify Hydrogen is a React-based framework designed for building
			custom storefronts that leverage the power of Shopify's ecommerce
			functionality. This report explores the key technologies needed to
			develop an eshop using Hydrogen.
		</p>
		<h3>Core Technologies</h3>

		<h4>Frontend</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>React:</strong> Hydrogen utilizes React, a popular
				JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developers
				familiar with React will find it easy to pick up Hydrogen.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Hydrogen React:</strong> This is a collection of
				pre-built React components specifically designed to interact
				with Shopify's Storefront API. These components streamline the
				development process by providing pre-built functionality for
				common ecommerce elements like product listings, carts, and
				checkout flows.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Backend</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Shopify Storefront API:</strong> Hydrogen interacts with
				Shopify through its Storefront API. This API allows developers
				to fetch product data, customer information, and manage carts
				entirely on the frontend, enabling a headless commerce
				architecture.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Oxygen (Optional):</strong> Shopify offers Oxygen, a
				global serverless hosting platform designed specifically for
				deploying Hydrogen storefronts. Oxygen simplifies deployment and
				ensures scalability for high-traffic stores.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Additional Technologies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>React Server Components (Experimental):</strong>
				Hydrogen offers the option to use React Server Components, an
				experimental technology that allows for server-side rendering
				within the React framework. This can improve SEO and initial
				page load times.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>CSS-in-JS Libraries (Optional):</strong> While not
				strictly required, using a CSS-in-JS library like Styled
				Components or Emotion can help manage styles within React
				components for a more maintainable codebase.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Benefits of using Shopify Hydrogen</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Faster Development:</strong> Pre-built components and a
				familiar development environment with React can significantly
				speed up development compared to building from scratch.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Hydrogen leverages
				Shopify's infrastructure for fast data retrieval and headless
				architecture enables a performant user experience.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Flexibility and Customization:</strong> While Hydrogen
				provides pre-built components, developers have the freedom to
				customize the storefront for a unique brand experience.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Seamless Integration with Shopify:</strong> Hydrogen
				integrates seamlessly with Shopify's backend functionality,
				ensuring a smooth flow between product management and storefront
				operations.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Considerations</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Frontend Development Expertise:</strong> Building a
				Hydrogen storefront requires experience with React and
				JavaScript. Familiarity with Shopify's Storefront API is also
				beneficial.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Early Stage Technology:</strong> While Hydrogen is
				open-source and under active development, some features like
				React Server Components are still experimental.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>

		<p>
			Shopify Hydrogen offers a powerful and efficient way to build custom
			storefronts that leverage the robust commerce features of Shopify.
			The combination of React, pre-built components, and headless
			architecture allows for fast development, performance, and a high
			degree of customization. However, some level of frontend development
			expertise is required, and some features are still under
			development. Overall, Hydrogen is a promising solution for
			businesses seeking a modern and scalable approach to ecommerce.
